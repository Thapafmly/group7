                    followed by the airports and gathers the scores as a "treasure" along the way. First, the program
                    prompts the user to enter his/her name, then the player selects the desired options from all the
                    continents, countries, and one out of three airports of the corresponding country. After each
                    navigation attempt, the player receives information on the number of remaining attempts,
                    the total number of attempts (3), weather, and the score. The player gets the notification of
                    weather condition of each arrival points. The weather information includes the temperature and
                    feels like (temperature) in degree celsius, and humidity in g/m^3. The program fetches the weather
                    data from API of https://openweathermap.org/api, maps data from the leaflet library,and data
                    elements like continents, country, airport, municipality from flight_game database.</p>

                    Our game is easier to understand! The goal is to find treasures
                    across the world, and the player gets to decide where! You get 3 attempts to do so. First,
                    you choose a continent and then after that a country. Then you can choose from 3 random airports
                    to find the treasure. If you get lucky, you find the reward and claim 500 points! After that,
                    the game ends and you see how many points you have collected so far.
